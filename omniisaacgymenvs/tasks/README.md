# Tasks

This folder contains the definition of several robotic tasks. In particular, `local_bm.py` implements the "one-finger", local-control task, *aka* the "local benchmark", and `global_bm.py` implements the "full-hand", global-control task, *aka* the "global benchmark".

## Local benchmark

The local benchmark consists in a simple task involving only oe robotuic finger. The latter is effort controlled, and interacts with a so-called "sliding button". The goal for the finger is to lift the button so as to place it in a certain high-rewrad zone.

## Global benchmark
